Water. Earth. Fire. Air. My grandmother used to tell me stories about the old days: a time of peace when the Avatar kept balance between the Water Tribes, Earth Kingdom, Fire Nation and Air Nomads. But that all changed when the Fire Nation attacked. Only the Avatar mastered all four elements; only he could stop the ruthless firebenders. But when the world needed him most, he vanished. A hundred years have passed, and the Fire Nation is nearing victory in the war. Two years ago, my father and the men of my tribe journeyed to the Earth Kingdom to help fight against the Fire Nation, leaving me and my brother to look after our tribe. Some people believe that the Avatar was never reborn into the Air Nomads and that the cycle is broken, but I haven't lost hope. I still believe that, somehow, the Avatar will return to save the world.
It's not getting away from me this time. [Close-up of the boy as he grins confidently over his shoulder in the direction of the girl.] Watch and learn, Katara. This is how you catch a fish.
[Happily surprised.] Sokka, look!
[Close-up of Sokka; whispering.] Sshh! Katara, you're going to scare it away. [A look of bliss adorns his face. He licks his lips and wiggles his fingers, not taking his eyes off the fish.] Mmmm ... I can already smell it cookin'.
[Struggling with the water that passes right in front of her.] But, Sokka! I caught one!
[Exclaims indignantly.] Hey!
Why is it that every time you play with magic water, I get soaked?
[Cut to her face; she sighs lightly before answering in slight annoyance.] It's not "magic", it's waterbending! And it's ...
Yeah, yeah, "an ancient art unique to our culture", blah, blah, blah. Look, I'm just saying [Grabbing his warrior's wolf knot with his left hand as he turns away from her, wringing the water out of it. Meanwhile, Katara has crossed her arms.] that if I had weird powers, I'd keep my weirdness to myself.
[Cut to her face as she raises an eyebrow skeptically, arms still crossed.] You're calling me weird? I'm not the one who makes muscles at myself every time I see my reflection in the water!
Watch out! Go left! Go left!
[A touch of bitterness in her voice.] You call that left?
You don't like my steering? Well, maybe you should've [He waves his hands, mockingly imitating waterbending.] waterbended us out of the ice.
[Indignantly.] So it's my fault?
[Annoyed.] I knew I should've left you home! [Cut to a close-up of the siblings; Katara is staring down at her brother in anger while he rants calmly.] Leave it to a girl to screw things up!
You are the most sexist, [She brings her hands up to her head and swings them back down and behind her in her rage; the movement creates a small wave of water behind her.] immature, [Hands raised back to her head.] nut brained ... [Swings her arms back down again, creating a slightly larger wave; she raises her hands back to her head during a brief loss for words.] I'm embarrassed [Throwing a hand upward, a short jet of water shoots upward as well.] to be related to you!
Ever since mom died, [Points to herself.] I've been doing all the work around camp while you've been off playing soldier!
[Pointing to the iceberg behind her, his voice subdued by fright.] Uh ... Katara ...
[Close-up of a rage-fueled Katara as she continues her outburst, a finger pointed in Sokka's face.] I even wash all the clothes! Have you ever smelled your dirty socks? Let me tell you, not pleasant!
[In a screeching voice, his eyes open wide in fear.] Katara, settle down!
No that's it! I'm done helping you! From now on, you're on your own!
Okay, you've gone from "weird" to "freakish", [He releases her.] Katara.
[Astonished.] You mean I did that?
[Sarcastically, glancing at her and smirking.] Yep. [Nudging her with his elbow.] Congratulations.
Several small bubbles appear on the surface of the water directly in front of them and a small spot of water begins to glow with a bright bluish hue. An overhead shot shows the spread of the brilliant glow and the bubbles within. Cut to the head-on close-up as the two siblings scramble back in renewed terror from the edge, just as a large, roughly spherical iceberg breaks the surface of the water.
The shot jumps behind Katara and Sokka as an iceberg rises above the surface, revealing its massive form to be the source of the glow. The crashing waves generated by the iceberg's rising push the floe backward as the berg itself rocks to one side, before coming to rest with its rounded dome exposed above the water. Mesmerized by the iceberg, Katara strays closer and stares at the iceberg; behind her, Sokka halfheartedly stretches out his hand, as if to hold her back. A few cuts ensue: the iceberg from behind Sokka and Katara; Katara's face as she stares at the object; and a shot of the iceberg itself, revealing a human shape within below a larger, indistinguishable mass. The human figure, perched in lotus, has glowing arrows on its head and hands. Close-up of Katara as she raises an eyebrow in confusion. The shot cuts to a closer view of the figure in the ice, its features accentuated by reflected light, revealing it to be a boy. Suddenly, the boy opens his eyes, the same brilliant light emanating from them, eliciting shocked gasps from both of the siblings.
He's alive! We have to help!
Before Sokka can grab it, Katara grabs Sokka's club out of its sheath on his back and pulls her hood over her head, heading in the direction of the strange boy sealed in the iceberg. Sokka again reaches out his hand in an attempt to hold Katara back, though she is already running across the ice.
Katara, get back here! [He grabs his spear from the ice and runs after Katara, who is already at the ice's edge.] We don't know what that thing is!
Katara hops across the short distance between her floe and the iceberg on five tiny chinks of ice; Sokka, close behind her, does the same. Reaching the iceberg first, Katara repeatedly strikes the iceberg with Sokka's club. On her fifth strike, the club breaks through the surface and a great gust of wind, which escapes from within the iceberg, throws her and her brother back from the side of the dome. Fissures quickly snake their way over the whole iceberg and, in a massive outward explosion, the entire orb of ice destroys itself. A beam of light bursts from the core of the iceberg and rockets into the sky. The camera shows the iceberg from the shallow sea bottom as it emits ripples of light. The scene switches to a group of tiger seals, who erect themselves to growl at the distant beam of light.
